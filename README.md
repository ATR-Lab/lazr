## Architecture

Telepresence robotic avatars one such as from [Avatar](https://g.co/kgs/KfuJ42), where a operator can control remotely located robot through a jacket. There are two different kinds of data generated here:

- Sensory Data and:
  
  Since the nature of these sensors generate time dependent data. The information generated from jacket consists of sensors such as following:

  * Feedback
  * Galvanic Skin Receptors
  * Haptic Sensors and 
  * Motion Sensors


- Video information:

  The video and audio feedback from robot while the operating the robot.

Considerations and understanding on what basis we've choosen this architecture, you may check out [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q2nAtQ_UcUGdLwagbxyHWk7RiwRFSflorGsx32z_9mc/edit?usp=sharing).


## Installations

Following are the list of technical stack required:

- [Python3.6](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

Or instead of Python you may use Anaconda 

- [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

- [PySpark](https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-pyspark-with-java-8-on-ubuntu-18-04-6a9dea915b5b)

- [Hadoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6oit3rCsZo&t=1668s)
